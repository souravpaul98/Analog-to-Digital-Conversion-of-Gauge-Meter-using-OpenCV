# Analog-to-Digital-Conversion-of-Gauge-Meter-using-OpenCV

Conversion of Analog Reading from gauge into Digital Data using OpenCV
Conversion of Analog Reading from gauge into Digital Data using Image Processing
Converting an Analog Readings from a Tensiometer into Digital Data using Image Processing
Programmed in Python with OpenCV library for Image Processing
Used line and circle detection techniques
Hardware setup consisted of Raspberry Pi as the processing module along with a RPi Camera Module

In the Code, the user has to adjust certain parameters such as Binary Threshold, and parameters related to the HoughCircles() and HoughLinesP() depending upon the image quality and the gauge meter.

Also the scale of the Gauge meter needs to be taken care of. The scale of the Gauge meter attached above might not be the same as another Gauge meter's scale.
